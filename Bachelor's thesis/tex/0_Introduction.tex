\section{ElateMe}
ElateMe is a new crowdfunding platform with elements of the social network. Unlike other similar projects like
Kickstarter or Patreon that help bring creative, commercial projects to life by means of interested people, ElateMe
is focused on fulfillment of personal wishes with the help of user’s friends. The user can create a wish and set
its cost, title, and a short description. His friends then will be able to contribute to his wish by donating money.
When wish gathers needed amount, money will be transferred to the user bank account. The social part of the
application is providing an ability for the user to subscribe to his friends, communicate with other users,
rate and comment others’ wishes.\par
