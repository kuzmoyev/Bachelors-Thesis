\section{ElateMe}
ElateMe is a new crowdfunding platform with elements of the social network. Unlike other similar projects like
Kickstarter or Patreon that help bring creative, commercial projects to life by means of interested people, ElateMe
focuses on the fulfillment of personal wishes with the help of user’s friends. The user can create a wish and set its
cost, title, and a short description. His friends then will be able to contribute by donating money. When wish gathers
needed amount, money will be transferred to the user bank account. The social part of the application is providing an
ability for the user to connect with his friends, communicate with other users, rate and comment others’ wishes.
